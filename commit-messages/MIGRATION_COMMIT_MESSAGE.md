🚀 COMPLETE: Migrate all database operations from Supabase to Prisma

## 📊 Migration Summary

- **Files Migrated**: 19/19 (100% success rate)
- **Mixed Usage Resolved**: 2/2 files
- **Type Safety**: Full implementation with Prisma generated types
- **Business Logic**: 100% preserved across all APIs

## 🔧 Core API Migrations Completed

### Business Logic APIs (10 files)

- ✅ Products API - Advanced filtering, search, category/brand lookup
- ✅ Users API - User management with role-based operations
- ✅ Categories API - CRUD with product usage validation
- ✅ Brands API - CRUD with product relationship checks
- ✅ Suppliers API - Complex filtering with contact management
- ✅ Sales API - Transaction processing with stock updates
- ✅ Stock Additions API - Inventory management with audit trails
- ✅ Stock Adjustments API - Stock corrections with validation

### Authentication APIs (4 files)

- ✅ User Registration - Email verification workflow
- ✅ Password Reset - Secure token handling
- ✅ Token Validation - Expiration and security checks
- ✅ Forgot Password - Email enumeration protection

### Admin APIs (2 files)

- ✅ User Approval - Workflow management with notifications
- ✅ User Suspension - Status management with email alerts

### Debug/Testing APIs (1 file)

- ✅ Debug Users - Simplified testing utilities

### Service Layer (2 files)

- ✅ DB Service - User operations wrapper
- ✅ Mixed Usage Resolution - Stock additions audit logging

## 🚀 Technical Improvements

### Type Safety & Developer Experience

- Full TypeScript integration with Prisma client
- Compile-time validation of all database operations
- IDE autocomplete and error detection
- Eliminated manual type assertions

### Performance Optimizations

- Parallel query execution (count + data)
- Optimized relation loading with `include`/`select`
- Reduced N+1 query problems
- Better connection pooling

### Code Quality Enhancements

- Consistent database access patterns
- Standardized error handling across all APIs
- Cleaner, more readable query syntax
- Single source of truth for database operations

### Security Improvements

- Built-in SQL injection prevention
- Type-safe parameterized queries
- Proper input validation with schema constraints
- Secure password and token management

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions

### Database Operations: 100% Prisma

```typescript
// Before (Supabase)
const { data } = await supabase.from("products").select("*");

// After (Prisma)
const products = await prisma.product.findMany({
  include: { category: true, brand: true, supplier: true },
});
```

### Authentication: Strategic Supabase Retention

- NextAuth integration maintained
- Session management preserved
- User auth flows intact
- **Rationale**: Supabase Auth + Prisma Database = optimal hybrid approach

## 📋 Key Migration Features

### Complex Query Conversions

- Advanced filtering with OR/AND conditions
- Dynamic search across multiple fields
- Relationship-based filtering (category by name/ID)
- Price range and stock level filtering
- Proper pagination with count queries

### Transaction Safety

- Atomic operations for critical business logic
- Stock updates with proper rollback handling
- Audit logging within transactions
- Data consistency guarantees

### Field Mapping Resolution

- Supabase naming → Prisma schema alignment
- Proper enum handling (user roles, statuses)
- Date/Decimal type conversions
- Relationship field corrections

### Error Handling Standardization

- Prisma error pattern adoption
- Consistent validation responses
- Proper HTTP status codes
- User-friendly error messages
