# Email Best Practices Setup

## ‚úÖ Fixed: No-Reply Email Issue

### Problem
Using `noreply@baawa.ng` was flagged as a best practice issue because:
- It decreases trust and engagement
- It indicates one-way communication
- Email clients flag it as potentially spam
- Users can't provide feedback or report issues

### Solution: Better Email Configuration

#### 1. Updated Sender Addresses

**Before:**
```
From: Baawa Accessories <noreply@baawa.ng>
```

**After:**
```
From: Baawa Accessories <support@baawa.ng>
Reply-To: support@baawa.ng
```

#### 2. Environment Variables to Update

Add these to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Email Configuration (Best Practices)
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=support@baawa.ng
RESEND_FROM_NAME="Baawa Accessories"
REPLY_TO_EMAIL=support@baawa.ng

# Email Addresses (Environment Variables)
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@baawa.ng
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@baawa.ng
SALES_EMAIL=sales@baawa.ng
```

#### 3. Email Address Strategy

| Purpose | Environment Variable | Email Address | Why |
|---------|---------------------|---------------|-----|
| **Transactional Emails** | `SUPPORT_EMAIL` | `support@baawa.ng` | Friendly, engaging, trustworthy |
| **Admin Notifications** | `ADMIN_EMAIL` | `admin@baawa.ng` | For system notifications |
| **Sales/Receipts** | `SALES_EMAIL` | `sales@baawa.ng` | For purchase confirmations |
| **Support/Reply-To** | `SUPPORT_EMAIL` | `support@baawa.ng` | Users can reply for help |

#### 4. Benefits of This Approach

‚úÖ **Better Deliverability** - Email clients trust friendly addresses  
‚úÖ **Higher Engagement** - Users feel comfortable replying  
‚úÖ **Better Spam Scores** - Avoids no-reply flags  
‚úÖ **Customer Support** - Users can reply for help  
‚úÖ **Professional Image** - Shows you care about communication  
‚úÖ **Environment Configurable** - Easy to change addresses without code changes  

#### 5. Email Types and Addresses

| Email Type | From Address | Reply-To | Environment Variable |
|------------|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| Welcome | `support@baawa.ng` | `support@baawa.ng` | `SUPPORT_EMAIL` |
| Verification | `support@baawa.ng` | `support@baawa.ng` | `SUPPORT_EMAIL` |
| Password Reset | `support@baawa.ng` | `support@baawa.ng` | `SUPPORT_EMAIL` |
| Receipts | `sales@baawa.ng` | `support@baawa.ng` | `SALES_EMAIL` |
| Admin Notifications | `admin@baawa.ng` | `support@baawa.ng` | `ADMIN_EMAIL` |

#### 6. Smart Email Routing

The system automatically chooses the right sender based on email content:

- **Admin emails** (containing "admin", "system", "digest") ‚Üí Uses `ADMIN_EMAIL`
- **Sales emails** (containing "receipt", "purchase", "order") ‚Üí Uses `SALES_EMAIL`
- **All other emails** ‚Üí Uses `SUPPORT_EMAIL`

#### 7. Domain Setup Required

Make sure these email addresses are configured in your domain:

1. **Primary**: `support@baawa.ng` - For most transactional emails
2. **Sales**: `sales@baawa.ng` - For purchase receipts and orders
3. **Admin**: `admin@baawa.ng` - For system notifications

#### 8. Testing the New Configuration

Run this test to verify the new setup:

```bash
node scripts/test-email-best-practices.js
```

#### 9. Gravatar Setup (for avatars)

Set up Gravatar for the new addresses:
- `support@baawa.ng` - Main transactional emails
- `sales@baawa.ng` - Sales and receipt emails
- `admin@baawa.ng` - Admin notifications
