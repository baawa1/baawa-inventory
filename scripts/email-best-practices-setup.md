# Email Best Practices Setup

## ‚úÖ Fixed: No-Reply Email Issue

### Problem
Using `noreply@baawa.ng` was flagged as a best practice issue because:
- It decreases trust and engagement
- It indicates one-way communication
- Email clients flag it as potentially spam
- Users can't provide feedback or report issues

### Solution: Better Email Configuration

#### 1. Updated Sender Addresses

**Before:**
```
From: Baawa Accessories <noreply@baawa.ng>
```

**After:**
```
From: Baawa Accessories <hello@baawa.ng>
Reply-To: support@baawa.ng
```

#### 2. Environment Variables to Update

Add these to your `.env.local`:

```bash
# Email Configuration (Best Practices)
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=hello@baawa.ng
RESEND_FROM_NAME="Baawa Accessories"
REPLY_TO_EMAIL=support@baawa.ng

# Support Email
SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@baawa.ng
```

#### 3. Email Address Strategy

| Purpose | Email Address | Why |
|---------|---------------|-----|
| **Transactional Emails** | `hello@baawa.ng` | Friendly, engaging, trustworthy |
| **Support/Reply-To** | `support@baawa.ng` | Users can reply for help |
| **Admin Notifications** | `admin@baawa.ng` | For system notifications |
