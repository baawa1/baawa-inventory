# Image Data Recovery Plan

## 🚨 Current Situation

- **397 products** in database
- **0 products** with image data (migration cleared them)
- **Supabase Storage** access issues (authentication problems)

## 🔍 Immediate Steps to Take

### Step 1: Check Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to your Supabase project: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Navigate to **Storage** → **Buckets**
3. Check if the `products` bucket exists and contains files
4. If files exist, note down the filenames

### Step 2: Check for Backups

Look for these files in your project:

- `backup/` directory
- `database/` directory
- `*.sql` files
- `*.dump` files
- Recent git commits with image data

### Step 3: Check Git History

```bash
# Check recent commits for image data
git log --oneline -10
git show <commit-hash> --name-only | grep -i image
```

## 🔧 Recovery Options

### Option A: Supabase Storage Recovery (If images still exist)

If images are still in Supabase Storage:

1. We'll create a recovery script to match filenames to products
2. Rebuild the image data in the new format
3. Update the database with the recovered data

### Option B: Manual Re-upload (If images are lost)

If images are completely lost:

1. Re-upload images using the new system
2. The new system will generate meaningful filenames and alt text
3. Better organization and SEO benefits

### Option C: Database Backup Recovery

If you have database backups:

1. Extract image URLs from backup
2. Check if files still exist in Supabase Storage
3. Rebuild image data in new format

## 📋 Recovery Script (When Ready)

Once we confirm images exist in Supabase, run:

```bash
node scripts/recover-from-storage.js
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Check Supabase Dashboard** - Confirm if images exist
2. **Check for backups** - Look for any backup files
3. **Let me know the results** - I'll create the appropriate recovery script
4. **Alternative: Re-upload** - If recovery isn't possible, we can re-upload with better organization

## 💡 Silver Lining

The new system provides significant improvements:

- ✅ **Meaningful filenames** (product-brand-category format)
- ✅ **Automatic alt text** generation
- ✅ **Better SEO** and accessibility
- ✅ **Editable alt text** for customization
- ✅ **Primary image designation**
- ✅ **Structured data** with proper validation

## 🚀 If Recovery Fails

If we can't recover the images:

1. The new system is much better organized
2. Re-uploading will give you better filenames and alt text
3. Future uploads will be more SEO-friendly
4. You'll have better accessibility features

## 📞 Next Action

Please:

1. Check your Supabase dashboard for images
2. Let me know what you find
3. I'll create the appropriate recovery solution
