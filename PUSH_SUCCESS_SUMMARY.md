## 🎯 Current Working System

### User Flow

1. **Register** → Email sent → Redirect to check email page
2. **Verify Email** → Click link → Status changes to VERIFIED
3. **Login (VERIFIED)** → Can login → Redirected to pending approval page
4. **Admin Approval** → Status changes to APPROVED
5. **Login (APPROVED)** → Full dashboard access

### User Status States

- **PENDING**: Just registered, email not verified
- **VERIFIED**: Email verified, awaiting admin approval ← **Can login to pending page**
- **APPROVED**: Admin approved, full system access
- **REJECTED/SUSPENDED**: Cannot login
