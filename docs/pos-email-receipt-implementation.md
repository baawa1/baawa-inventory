# POS Email Receipt Implementation

## Overview

After a POS order is completed, the system now automatically sends an email receipt to the buyer if a customer email address is provided during checkout. This feature enhances the customer experience by providing a professional, itemized receipt via email.

## Implementation Details

### 1. API Endpoint Enhancement

**File:** `src/app/api/pos/create-sale/route.ts`

The `/api/pos/create-sale` endpoint has been enhanced to:

- ✅ Process the sale transaction as before
- ✅ Update product stock levels
- ✅ **NEW:** Automatically send email receipt if customer email is provided
- ✅ Return email status in the response

#### Key Changes:

```typescript
// After successful sale creation, check for customer email
if (validatedData.customerEmail) {
  try {
    // Get staff user details for email
    const staffUser = await prisma.user.findUnique({
      where: { id: parseInt(request.user.id) },
      select: { firstName: true, lastName: true },
    });

    // Prepare email data with complete transaction details
    const emailData = {
      to: validatedData.customerEmail,
      customerName: validatedData.customerName || 'Customer',
      saleId: result.salesTransaction.id.toString(),
      items: result.salesItems.map(item => ({
        name: item.productName,
        quantity: item.quantity,
        price: Number(item.unit_price),
        total: Number(item.total_price),
      })),
      subtotal: validatedData.subtotal,
      discount: validatedData.discount,
      total: validatedData.total,
      paymentMethod: validatedData.paymentMethod,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      staffName,
    };

    // Send email receipt
    emailSent = await emailService.sendReceiptEmail(emailData);
  } catch (emailError) {
    // Don't fail the transaction if email fails
    console.error('Error sending email receipt:', emailError);
  }
}
```

### 2. Email Service Integration

**File:** `src/lib/email/service.ts`

The existing email service already includes a `sendReceiptEmail` function that:

- ✅ Uses professional HTML templates
- ✅ Includes itemized receipt with product details
- ✅ Shows payment method and staff information
- ✅ Includes business branding and return policy
- ✅ Provides both HTML and text fallback formats

#### Email Template Features:

- **Professional Design**: Clean, branded HTML template
- **Itemized Receipt**: Complete list of purchased items with quantities and prices
- **Transaction Details**: Sale ID, date, payment method, staff name
- **Business Information**: Return policy and contact details
- **Responsive Design**: Works on mobile and desktop email clients

### 3. Frontend Integration

**Files:** 
- `src/components/pos/PaymentInterface.tsx`
- `src/components/pos/SlidingPaymentInterface.tsx`

Both payment interfaces now show appropriate success messages based on email status:

```typescript
// Show success message with email status
if (result.emailSent && customerInfo.email) {
  toast.success('Payment processed successfully! Email receipt sent to customer.');
} else if (customerInfo.email) {
  toast.success('Payment processed successfully! (Email receipt failed to send)');
} else {
  toast.success('Payment processed successfully!');
}
```

## Email Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

To enable email receipts, set these environment variables:

```bash
# Email Service Configuration
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here
RESEND_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@baawa.ng
RESEND_FROM_NAME=Baawa Accessories

# Optional: Reply-to email
REPLY_TO_EMAIL=support@baawa.ng
```

### Email Provider Setup

The system uses **Resend** as the primary email provider:

1. **Sign up** at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
2. **Verify your domain** (baawa.ng) in the Resend dashboard
3. **Get your API key** from the Resend dashboard
4. **Add the API key** to your environment variables

## Email Template Structure

### HTML Template Features

```html
<!-- Professional receipt template includes: -->
- Baawa Accessories branding
- Customer name and transaction details
- Itemized product list with quantities and prices
- Subtotal, discount, and total calculations
- Payment method and staff information
- Return policy information
- Business contact details
```

### Text Fallback

The system also provides a plain text version for email clients that don't support HTML.

## Testing the Feature

### 1. Manual Testing

1. **Navigate to POS**: Go to `/pos` in your application
2. **Add items to cart**: Search and add products
3. **Enter customer email**: Fill in the customer email field during checkout
4. **Complete transaction**: Process the payment
5. **Check email**: Verify the receipt is sent to the customer

### 2. Automated Testing

Run the test script to verify the functionality:

```bash
node scripts/test-pos-email-simple.js
```

This script will:
- ✅ Check database connection
- ✅ Verify sample products are available
- ✅ Simulate sale data structure
- ✅ Check email configuration
- ✅ Provide testing instructions

### 3. Test Email Addresses

For development/testing, emails are redirected to:
- `baawapay+pos-test@gmail.com`
- `baawapay+pos-db-test@gmail.com`
- `baawapay+pos-api-test@gmail.com`

## Error Handling

### Graceful Degradation

The system is designed to handle email failures gracefully:

- ✅ **Transaction Success**: Sale is recorded even if email fails
- ✅ **Error Logging**: Email errors are logged but don't break the transaction
- ✅ **User Feedback**: Success message indicates email status
- ✅ **Fallback**: Manual email sending is still available via receipt interface

### Common Issues and Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Email not sent | Missing API key | Set `RESEND_API_KEY` environment variable |
| Email not sent | Unverified domain | Verify domain in Resend dashboard |
| Email not sent | Invalid from email | Use verified domain email address |
| Template errors | Missing environment variables | Set all required email variables |

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- ✅ **Email Validation**: Customer emails are validated before sending
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Email failures don't expose sensitive information
- ✅ **Logging**: Email attempts are logged for audit purposes
- ✅ **Rate Limiting**: Email service includes rate limiting protection

### Privacy Compliance

- ✅ **Customer Consent**: Email is only sent when customer provides email
- ✅ **Data Minimization**: Only necessary transaction data is included
- ✅ **Secure Transmission**: Emails sent via secure SMTP/API

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Overhead

The email sending adds minimal overhead to the transaction:

- ✅ **Async Processing**: Email is sent after successful transaction
- ✅ **Non-blocking**: Email failures don't affect transaction success
- ✅ **Efficient**: Uses existing email service infrastructure
- ✅ **Cached Templates**: Email templates are cached for performance

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Email Templates**: Add more template variations (different styles, languages)
2. **SMS Receipts**: Send SMS receipts for customers without email
3. **Receipt Customization**: Allow staff to add custom messages
4. **Bulk Receipts**: Send receipts for multiple transactions
5. **Receipt History**: Store sent receipts for audit purposes

### Integration Opportunities

1. **Customer Database**: Link receipts to customer profiles
2. **Loyalty Program**: Include loyalty points in receipts
3. **Marketing**: Add promotional content to receipts
4. **Analytics**: Track receipt open rates and engagement

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Steps

1. **Check Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   echo $RESEND_API_KEY
   echo $RESEND_FROM_EMAIL
   echo $RESEND_FROM_NAME
   ```

2. **Test Email Service**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/test-pos-email-simple.js
   ```

3. **Check Application Logs**:
   - Look for email-related error messages
   - Verify transaction success messages
   - Check for email service errors

4. **Verify Resend Setup**:
   - Confirm API key is valid
   - Verify domain is properly configured
   - Check Resend dashboard for delivery status

### Common Error Messages

| Error | Meaning | Solution |
|-------|---------|----------|
| "Email receipt failed to send" | Email service error | Check email configuration |
| "Failed to create sale" | Transaction error | Check database connection |
| "Validation error" | Invalid data | Verify sale data structure |
