# POS Access Issue Resolution

## Problem Summary

The POS system at `/pos` was redirecting all users to the pending-approval page, preventing any users from accessing the Point of Sale functionality.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the POS page authentication logic (`src/app/(dashboard)/pos/page.tsx`). The code was checking for:

```typescript
if (session.user.status !== "active") {
  redirect("/pending-approval");
}
```

However, the actual user status values in the database are:

- `APPROVED` - Users who have been approved by admin
- `VERIFIED` - Users who have been verified
- `PENDING` - Users awaiting approval
- `REJECTED` - Users who have been rejected

The system was looking for `"active"` status which doesn't exist in the database.

## Resolution

Changed the authentication logic to check for the correct status values:

```typescript
if (!["APPROVED", "VERIFIED"].includes(session.user.status)) {
  redirect("/pending-approval");
}
```

## Current System Status

4. `role: "ADMIN" OR "MANAGER" OR "STAFF"`

### üß™ Testing Status

- **Access Control**: ‚úÖ Verified working
