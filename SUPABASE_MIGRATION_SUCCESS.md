# Supabase Migration Success

## What was done

1. Removed all Supabase dependencies and migrated to Prisma:
   - Removed Supabase client files (`src/lib/supabase.ts`, `src/lib/supabase-server.ts`, `src/lib/supabase-test.ts`)
   - Removed redundant Supabase-dependent API route (`src/app/api/auth/reset-password-supabase/route.ts`)
   - Updated import paths to use centralized role management system

2. Enhanced the inventory service with proper transaction handling:
   - Implemented efficient low stock products query
   - Added sales transaction management methods with proper transaction handling
   - Ensured consistent audit logging for all operations

3. Updated all API routes to use the centralized inventory service:
   - Updated `src/app/api/products/low-stock/route.ts` to use the inventory service
   - Updated `src/app/api/sales/[id]/route.ts` to use the inventory service
   - Fixed role permission imports to use the centralized system

4. Improved role-based access control:
   - Added specific permission for viewing low stock products
   - Added helper function to check for low stock viewing permission
   - Ensured consistent permission checking across all endpoints

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Codebase**: Removed duplicate code and consolidated database access through Prisma
2. **Improved Reliability**: Proper transaction handling for all stock updates
3. **Better Performance**: More efficient queries for low stock products
4. **Enhanced Security**: Consistent role-based access control
5. **Maintainability**: Centralized inventory operations in a single service

## Next Steps

1. Continue reviewing and optimizing query performance
2. Add more comprehensive error handling
3. Implement additional frontend improvements for loading states
4. Enhance test coverage for critical inventory operations
