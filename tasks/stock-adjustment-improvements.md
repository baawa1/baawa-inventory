# Stock Adjustment System Improvements

## Overview

Simplify the stock management system with two clear functions:

1. **Add Stock Popup** - Simple stock additions for new purchases (popup only)
2. **Stock Reconciliation** - Multi-product adjustments with approval workflow
3. **Stock History Page** - Audit trail of all stock movements and purchases

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Schema Updates

- [x] Create `stock_additions` table for tracking stock purchases
  - [x] Fields: id, product_id, quantity, cost_per_unit, supplier_id, purchase_date, notes, created_by, created_at

## Final Implementation Summary

The stock management system has been successfully simplified into three clear components:

1. **Add Stock Popup** - Quick and easy stock additions for purchases
   - Accessible from product list actions
   - Includes supplier, cost, and reference tracking
   - Automatically updates inventory and calculates weighted average cost

2. **Stock Reconciliation** - Complex multi-product adjustments
   - Full workflow with draft, submission, and approval stages
   - Handles discrepancies, damage, theft, and other adjustments
   - Requires admin approval for changes

3. **Stock History Page** - Complete audit trail
   - Shows all stock additions with before/after quantities
   - Searchable and filterable interface
   - Export functionality for reporting
   - Accessible at `/inventory/stock-history`

This approach eliminates confusion by having clear use cases:

- **Need to add purchased stock?** → Use the popup
- **Need to adjust multiple products?** → Use reconciliation
- **Need to see what happened?** → Check stock history
