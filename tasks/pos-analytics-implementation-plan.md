## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step implementation of a comprehensive POS analytics system for informed business decision-making.

## Analytics Pages Structure

### Main Analytics Page (`/pos/analytics`)
**Purpose**: Quick glance dashboard for immediate business insights

**Content**:
- **4 Key KPI Cards** (at a glance):
  - Total Revenue (with % change from previous period)
  - Total Orders (with % change)
  - Average Order Value (with % change)
  - Unique Customers (with % change)
- **Simple Revenue Chart** (line chart - last 30 days)
- **Top 5 Products** (by revenue)
- **Recent 5 Transactions** (latest sales)
- **Date Range Filter** (using existing shadcn DateRangePicker)

### Sub-pages (Simple & Focused):
1. **Sales Analytics** (`/pos/analytics/sales`) - Sales breakdown table with filters
2. **Product Analytics** (`/pos/analytics/products`) - Product performance table
3. **Category Analytics** (`/pos/analytics/categories`) - Category performance table

**Note**: Keep it simple - no complex charts, just clean tables with the data you need to make quick decisions.
