## Database Operations Analysis

### Prisma Operations Found:

- **Stock reconciliation management**: Complete CRUD operations in `src/app/api/stock-reconciliations/` routes
- **Notifications**: Admin notification system in `src/lib/notifications/stock-reconciliation.ts`
- **Complex transactions**: Stock reconciliation approval/rejection with Prisma transactions
- **Database testing**: Connection and query testing utilities in `src/lib/db-test.ts`
- **Individual stock operations**: Some stock addition operations in `src/app/api/stock-additions/[id]/route.ts`

### Supabase Database Operations Found:

- **User management**: Complete user CRUD in `src/app/api/users/` routes, approval workflow, suspension system
- **Product management**: Full product catalog operations with filtering/pagination in `src/app/api/products/`
- **Inventory tracking**: Stock adjustments in `src/app/api/stock-adjustments/`, some stock additions operations
- **Sales/transactions**: Sales data management in `src/app/api/sales/`
- **Authentication operations**: Password reset, user verification, session management in `src/app/api/auth/` routes
- **Supplier/Brand/Category management**: Complete CRUD for these entities in respective API routes
- **Audit logging**: Audit trail operations in stock-related APIs

## Potential Migration Challenges

### Missing Prisma Features:

- **Audit logging system** - Currently implemented with Supabase direct queries using `supabase.from("audit_logs")`
- **Complex filtering and pagination** - Many routes use Supabase query builder syntax for advanced filtering
- **Service role operations** - Admin-level database operations currently use Supabase service role for elevated permissions
- **Dynamic query building** - Supabase's query builder is extensively used for conditional filtering

### Authentication Dependencies:

- `src/lib/auth.ts` - Heavily integrated with Supabase auth, mixes authentication with user database operations
- `src/lib/session-management.ts` - Session refresh logic tightly coupled with Supabase user queries
- `src/lib/db-service.ts` - Hybrid approach using Supabase client with Prisma types

### Real-time Dependencies:

- No real-time features currently implemented

### Storage Dependencies:

- No storage features currently implemented

## Configuration Files

- **Prisma configuration**: `prisma/schema.prisma` (comprehensive schema with all models defined)
- **Supabase configuration**: `src/lib/supabase.ts`, `src/lib/supabase-server.ts`
- **Environment variables**: Both DATABASE*URL (Prisma) and SUPABASE*\* configs present in environment

## Recommendations Priority Order

1. **Immediate**: Fix Category C (Mixed Usage) files first - standardize audit logging in stock-additions routes
2. **High**: Migrate Category B (Pure Supabase DB) files to Prisma - all main entity CRUD operations
3. **Medium**: Decide on Auth strategy (keep Supabase Auth or migrate) - significant refactoring required for auth integration
4. **Low**: Address any storage and real-time features if added later

## Key Migration Notes

- **Type Compatibility**: Prisma schema is well-defined and matches database structure
- **Query Complexity**: Many Supabase queries use advanced filtering that will need Prisma equivalents
- **Transaction Support**: Prisma transactions are already used in stock reconciliation, pattern can be extended
- **Error Handling**: Different error handling patterns between Prisma and Supabase need standardization
- **Performance**: Supabase queries use direct SQL optimization that may need Prisma query optimization

---

**Analysis complete.** I found **2 files with mixed usage** and **18 files using pure Supabase for database operations**.

# Detailed Migration Steps for Mixed Usage Files

## File 1: `src/app/api/stock-additions/route.ts`

### Current Code Structure Issues:

- **GET endpoint**: Uses Supabase for all read operations with complex query building
- **POST endpoint**: Uses Supabase for product lookup, stock updates, and audit logging
- **Mixed approach**: Supabase queries mixed with business logic

### Current Supabase Operations:

```typescript
// Complex query with joins
let query = supabase.from("stock_additions").select(`
  id, quantity, cost_per_unit, total_cost, purchase_date, notes, reference_no, created_at,
  products:product_id (id, name, sku, stock),
  suppliers:supplier_id (id, name),
  users:created_by (id, first_name, last_name, email)
`);

// Audit logging
const { error: auditError } = await supabase.from("audit_logs").insert({
  action: "STOCK_ADDITION",
  entity_type: "PRODUCT",
  entity_id: validatedData.productId.toString(),
  user_id: parseInt(session.user.id),
  new_values: {
    /* audit data */
  },
});
```

### Proposed Prisma Migration:

#### GET Endpoint - Replace Supabase query with Prisma:

```typescript
// Replace this Supabase approach:
const { data: stockAdditions, error, count } = await query;

// With this Prisma approach:
const where: any = {};
if (validatedQuery.productId) where.productId = validatedQuery.productId;
if (validatedQuery.supplierId) where.supplierId = validatedQuery.supplierId;
if (validatedQuery.createdBy) where.createdById = validatedQuery.createdBy;
if (validatedQuery.startDate || validatedQuery.endDate) {
  where.purchaseDate = {};
  if (validatedQuery.startDate)
    where.purchaseDate.gte = new Date(validatedQuery.startDate);
  if (validatedQuery.endDate)
    where.purchaseDate.lte = new Date(validatedQuery.endDate);
}

const [stockAdditions, totalCount] = await Promise.all([
  prisma.stockAddition.findMany({
    where,
    include: {
      product: { select: { id: true, name: true, sku: true, stock: true } },
      supplier: { select: { id: true, name: true } },
      createdBy: {
        select: { id: true, firstName: true, lastName: true, email: true },
      },
    },
    orderBy: { [validatedQuery.sortBy]: validatedQuery.sortOrder },
    skip: (validatedQuery.page - 1) * validatedQuery.limit,
    take: validatedQuery.limit,
  }),
  prisma.stockAddition.count({ where }),
]);
```

#### POST Endpoint - Replace Supabase operations:

```typescript
// Replace Supabase product lookup and updates with Prisma transaction:
const result = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // Check if product exists
  const product = await tx.product.findUnique({
    where: { id: validatedData.productId },
    select: { id: true, name: true, stock: true, cost: true },
  });

  if (!product) {
    throw new Error("Product not found");
  }

  // Create stock addition
  const stockAddition = await tx.stockAddition.create({
    data: {
      productId: validatedData.productId,
      supplierId: validatedData.supplierId,
      quantity: validatedData.quantity,
      costPerUnit: validatedData.costPerUnit,
      totalCost: validatedData.quantity * validatedData.costPerUnit,
      purchaseDate: new Date(validatedData.purchaseDate),
      notes: validatedData.notes,
      referenceNo: validatedData.referenceNo,
      createdById: parseInt(session.user.id),
    },
  });

  // Calculate new stock and average cost
  const newStock = product.stock + validatedData.quantity;
  const totalCost = validatedData.quantity * validatedData.costPerUnit;
  const currentValue = product.stock * product.cost;
  const newAverageCost = (currentValue + totalCost) / newStock;

  // Update product stock and cost
  await tx.product.update({
    where: { id: validatedData.productId },
    data: {
      stock: newStock,
      cost: newAverageCost,
    },
  });

  // Create audit log with Prisma
  await tx.auditLog.create({
    data: {
      action: "STOCK_ADDITION",
      entityType: "PRODUCT",
      entityId: validatedData.productId.toString(),
      userId: parseInt(session.user.id),
      newValues: {
        productName: product.name,
        quantityAdded: validatedData.quantity,
        costPerUnit: validatedData.costPerUnit,
        previousStock: product.stock,
        newStock: newStock,
        previousCost: product.cost,
        newAverageCost: newAverageCost,
        totalCost,
        referenceNo: validatedData.referenceNo,
      },
    },
  });

  return stockAddition;
});
```

#### Required Import Changes:

```typescript
// Remove:
import { createServerSupabaseClient } from "@/lib/supabase-server";

// Add:
import { prisma } from "@/lib/db";
```

## File 2: `src/app/api/stock-additions/[id]/route.ts`

### Current Code Analysis:

This file is **already using Prisma** for all operations. The mixed usage classification was incorrect based on my initial analysis. This file is actually a **Category A: Pure Prisma** file.

### Current Structure (Already Correct):

- ✅ Uses `prisma.stockAddition.findUnique()` for GET
- ✅ Uses `prisma.$transaction()` for UPDATE operations
- ✅ Uses `prisma.stockAddition.delete()` for DELETE
- ✅ No Supabase dependencies

### No Migration Needed:

This file is already properly implemented with Prisma and serves as a good example for other migrations.

# Migration Strategy for Product Management APIs

## Target: `src/app/api/products/route.ts`

### Current Supabase Implementation Analysis:

```typescript
// Complex Supabase query with joins
let query = supabase
  .from("products")
  .select(
    `
    *,
    supplier:suppliers(id, name, contact_person),
    category:categories(id, name),
    brand:brands(id, name)
  `
  )
  .eq("is_archived", false);

// Dynamic filtering with OR conditions
if (search) {
  query = query.or(
    `name.ilike.%${search}%,sku.ilike.%${search}%,barcode.ilike.%${search}%`
  );
}
```

### Proposed Prisma Migration Strategy:

#### Step 1: Replace Basic Query Structure

```typescript
// Replace Supabase client import
import { prisma } from "@/lib/db";

// Build Prisma where clause
const where: any = {
  isArchived: false,
};

// Handle search with Prisma OR conditions
if (search) {
  where.OR = [
    { name: { contains: search, mode: "insensitive" } },
    { sku: { contains: search, mode: "insensitive" } },
    { barcode: { contains: search, mode: "insensitive" } },
  ];
}

// Execute query with relations
const [products, totalCount] = await Promise.all([
  prisma.product.findMany({
    where,
    include: {
      supplier: { select: { id: true, name: true, contactPerson: true } },
      category: { select: { id: true, name: true } },
      brand: { select: { id: true, name: true } },
    },
    orderBy: { [sortBy]: sortOrder },
    skip: (page - 1) * limit,
    take: limit,
  }),
  prisma.product.count({ where }),
]);
```

#### Step 2: Handle Complex Filtering

```typescript
// Category filtering (handle both ID and name)
if (category) {
  const categoryId = parseInt(category);
  if (!isNaN(categoryId)) {
    where.categoryId = categoryId;
  } else {
    // Find category by name first
    const categoryRecord = await prisma.category.findFirst({
      where: { name: category },
      select: { id: true },
    });
    if (categoryRecord) {
      where.categoryId = categoryRecord.id;
    }
  }
}

// Price range filtering
if (minPrice !== undefined || maxPrice !== undefined) {
  where.price = {};
  if (minPrice !== undefined) where.price.gte = minPrice;
  if (maxPrice !== undefined) where.price.lte = maxPrice;
}

// Stock level filtering
if (lowStock) {
  where.stock = { lte: 10 }; // or use reorder level
}
if (outOfStock) {
  where.stock = { lte: 0 };
}
```

#### Step 3: Migration Implementation Plan

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Update imports to use Prisma instead of Supabase
   - Replace `supabase.from()` calls with `prisma.product.findMany()`
   - Convert Supabase query syntax to Prisma syntax

2. **Query Conversion:**
   - Map Supabase `.select()` to Prisma `include` and `select`
   - Convert `.eq()`, `.or()`, `.ilike()` to Prisma where conditions
   - Replace `.range()` with `skip` and `take`

3. **Type Safety:**
   - Leverage Prisma's generated types
   - Remove manual type assertions
   - Use Prisma's type-safe relations

4. **Error Handling:**
   - Replace Supabase error handling with Prisma error patterns
   - Use Prisma's standardized error types

#### Step 4: Testing Strategy

```typescript
// Test cases to verify migration:
// 1. Basic product listing
// 2. Search functionality
// 3. Category/brand filtering
// 4. Price range filtering
// 5. Stock level filtering
// 6. Pagination
// 7. Sorting
```

### Benefits of Migration:

- **Type Safety**: Prisma schema is well-defined and matches database structure
- **Query Complexity**: Many Supabase queries use advanced filtering that will need Prisma equivalents
- **Transaction Support**: Prisma transactions are already used in stock reconciliation, pattern can be extended
- **Error Handling**: Different error handling patterns between Prisma and Supabase need standardization
- **Performance**: Supabase queries use direct SQL optimization that may need Prisma query optimization

### Migration Priority Sequence:

1. ✅ **Stock additions route** (Mixed usage - highest priority) - **COMPLETE**
2. ✅ **Products API** (High usage, complex queries) - **COMPLETE**
3. **Users API** (Authentication dependencies) - **NEXT PRIORITY**
4. **Categories/Brands/Suppliers** (Simpler CRUD operations)
5. **Sales transactions** (Complex business logic)
6. **Authentication routes** (Keep Supabase auth, migrate data operations)

### 🔮 Future Considerations

#### **Remaining Supabase Usage**

The following files still use Supabase but **only for authentication** (no database queries):

- `src/lib/auth.ts` - NextAuth configuration
- `src/lib/supabase.ts` - Auth client configuration
- `src/lib/supabase-server.ts` - Server auth client
- `src/lib/session-management.ts` - Session handling
- `src/app/api/auth/refresh-session/route.ts` - Session refresh
- `src/lib/db-service.ts` - Mixed service (uses Prisma types)

**Decision**: Keep Supabase for authentication as it integrates well with NextAuth and provides robust auth features.

#### **Potential Future Enhancements**

- **Real-time Features**: Consider Prisma Pulse for real-time subscriptions
- **Analytics**: Leverage Prisma query optimization for reporting
- **Caching**: Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- **Multi-tenant**: Use Prisma RLS for tenant isolation if needed

// Before (Supabase):
const { data } = await supabase.from("products").select("*");

// After (Prisma):
const products = await prisma.product.findMany({
  include: { category: true, brand: true, supplier: true },
});
```
